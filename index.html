                <h2>Football Academy</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The id attribute is used to refer to the id #home that is used for the "SC17" link at the top left
                    of the page. Absolute units like "px" are used here as well. Meanwhile, relative units like "%" and
                    "em" are used elsewhere in this page. The class attribute is used throughout the file for multiple
                    elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "box model" is used for throughout the files as well. One example is the image on the right. It
                    has set margins and border. In this case, I didn't change the padding as it would add a gap between
                    the border and picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the layout for this text and the picture on the right is by using the "float"
                    property.
                </p>

            <h2 class="fac">Facilities</h2>
            <p class="fac">The ":hover" pseudo-class is applied to the collection of pictures below. The pictures are
                organized into an article element. When the article element is hovered over, the individual pictures
                will all have their margins removed, so all the images are displayed side by side. The individual images
                also has layering effect where the "z-index" is increased when hovered on, so that the image appears in
                front of the
                others
                when it is scaled larger. </p>

                    This is text that will only be displayed when the collection of images are hovered upon. This is
                    through using the "display:" property. The "display:" property for this text is set to 'none' by
                    default, then changed to 'block' when the images are being hovered on.
